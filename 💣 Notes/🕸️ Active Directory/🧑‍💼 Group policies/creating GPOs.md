# creating GPOs

Let's create a new GPO called `Restrict Control Panel Access` and open it for editing. Since we want this GPO to apply to specific users, we will look under `User Configuration` for the following policy:

Notice we have enabled the **Prohibit Access to Control Panel and PC settings** policy.

Once the GPO is configured, we will need to link it to all of the OUs
 corresponding to users who shouldn't have access to the Control Panel 
of their PCs. In this case, we will link the `Marketing`, `Management` and `Sales` OUs by dragging the GPO to each of them:

***Auto Lock Screen GPO***

For the first GPO, regarding screen locking for workstations and servers, we could directly apply it over the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs we created previously.

While this solution should work, an alternative consists of simply 
applying the GPO to the root domain, as we want the GPO to affect all of
 our computers. Since the `Workstations`, `Servers` and `Domain Controllers` OUs are all child OUs of the root domain, they will inherit its policies.

**Note:** You might notice that if our GPO is applied to the root domain, it will also be inherited by other OUs like `Sales` or `Marketing`. Since these OUs contain users only, any Computer Configuration in our GPO will be ignored by them.

Let's create a new GPO, call it `Auto Lock Screen`, and edit it. The policy to achieve what we want is located in the following route:

We will set the inactivity limit to 5 minutes so that computers get 
locked automatically if any user leaves their session open. After 
closing the GPO editor, we will link the GPO to the root domain by 
dragging the GPO to it:
